                    <p class="lead">
                        I am a passionate Full Stack Software Engineer and aspiring Machine Learning Engineer dedicated to building 
                        innovative digital banking solutions that create exceptional user experiences and drive business impact.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My journey in technology began with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from the University of Nairobi, 
                        where I developed a deep fascination with building systems that solve real-world problems at scale. Over the 
                        past 3+ years, I've had the privilege of working at the intersection of banking and technology, designing and 
                        developing large-scale applications with over 100,000 users, primarily running in AWS cloud environments.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a Senior Software Engineer at Stanbic Bank Kenya, I specialize in payments integrations and APIs development, 
                        working extensively with the Backbase platform. My expertise spans both front-end technologies (HTML, CSS, 
                        JavaScript, TypeScript, Angular) and backend development (Spring Boot, Django) in microservices architecture. 
                        I excel at understanding and implementing complex business logic with the end user at the forefront of my mind.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What sets me apart is my versatility across the full technology stack—from crafting intuitive front-end 
                        interfaces to architecting robust backend APIs, managing integrations via IBM APIConnect Gateway, and 
                        implementing Robotic Process Automation using Python and Microsoft PowerAutomate. I am adept at resolving 
                        complex issues arising across all layers of a solution.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm a very quick learner, which allows me to grasp and utilize new technologies rapidly. I use Git version 
                        control, Scrum agile methodologies, Jira for project management, and Confluence for documentation—ensuring 
                        every project is well-organized and clearly documented.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Currently, I'm expanding my leadership capabilities by pursuing a Master of Business Administration (MBA) 
                        from the University of East London and completed Organizational Leadership training from the University of 
                        California, Riverside. This combination of technical expertise and business acumen positions me to drive 
                        digital transformation initiatives at both technical and strategic levels.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm excited about the future of digital banking and the transformative role that technology, particularly 
                        Machine Learning and AI, will continue to play in financial services. As a passionate individual who takes 
                        pride in delivering key project requirements, I look forward to propelling businesses to the next level 
                        and contributing to innovation at a regional and global scale.
