HOW TO ADD YOUR PROFILE PHOTO
================================

STEP 1: PREPARE YOUR PHOTO
---------------------------
✓ Use a professional headshot
✓ Good lighting, clear face, solid or simple background
✓ Business casual or formal attire
✓ Square or portrait orientation works best
✓ Smile naturally and look confident

STEP 2: OPTIMIZE YOUR IMAGE
----------------------------
Recommended specifications:
- Size: 800x800 pixels (or 1000x1000 for high resolution)
- Format: JPG or PNG
- File size: Under 500KB for fast loading
- Quality: High quality, but compressed for web

Tools to resize/compress:
- Online: tinypng.com, squoosh.app, or iloveimg.com
- Mac: Preview app (Tools > Adjust Size)
- Windows: Paint or Photos app

STEP 3: SAVE YOUR PHOTO
------------------------
Save your photo with ONE of these names:
✓ profile.jpg  (recommended)
✓ profile.png

Place it in THIS folder:
/Users/benedictmusila/Documents/Personalised/MyPortfolio/assets/

STEP 4: VERIFY
--------------
After adding your photo:
1. Open index.html in your browser (or refresh if already open)
2. You should see your photo at the top of the page
3. It will be displayed as a circular professional headshot

SUPPORTED FILE NAMES
---------------------
The website is currently configured to look for:
- assets/profile.jpg

If you want to use a different filename (like profile.png), 
update line 63 in index.html:
<img src="assets/profile.jpg" ...>
Change to:
<img src="assets/profile.png" ...>

TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------
Photo not showing?
1. Check the filename is exactly "profile.jpg" (lowercase)
2. Make sure it's in the assets folder
3. Try refreshing your browser (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
4. Check browser console for errors (F12 > Console)

Photo looks stretched?
- Make sure your photo is roughly square (same width and height)
- The website will automatically crop it to a circle

Photo file too large?
- Compress it using tinypng.com or squoosh.app
- Aim for under 500KB for fast loading

TIPS FOR BEST RESULTS
----------------------
✓ Natural, professional smile
✓ Eye contact with the camera
✓ Simple, non-distracting background
✓ Good contrast (your face stands out from background)
✓ Professional attire appropriate for your industry
✓ Recent photo (within last 1-2 years)

Your photo will appear:
- At the top of the homepage (Hero section)
- As a circular professional headshot
- With hover effect (slight zoom on mouse over)
- Responsive on all devices (mobile, tablet, desktop)

Once you add your photo, your website will be complete! 🎉
